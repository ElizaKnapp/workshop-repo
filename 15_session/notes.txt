K15 -- Sessions Greetings

First, we ran the app from hw 14 and inputted a username. In the dev console, 
we saw a get request from the localhost that we are running the app on,
but then, it said 404 not found when it searches for a favicon.ico. We looked
it up and it said that it was just the tab icon that it looked for but then 
didn't find.

We have set up the conditional in app.py that checks whether the method
is a post or a get method to determine whether to use .args or .form.
We are not yet sure why it really matters what the difference is. We 
have yet to create a session.

Cookies! Stored locally! Server maintains the cookies, client uses them.
request.cookies.get('username') same as -> request.form['username']
Sessions in flask
- maintained by server, stored on client
- payload encoded (not encrypted)
- dictionary
- cookie is securely signed
