K15 -- Sessions Greetings
2021-10-18

First, we ran the app from hw 14 and inputted a username. In the dev console, 
we saw a get request from the localhost that we are running the app on,
but then, it said 404 not found when it searches for a favicon.ico. We looked
it up and it said that it was just the tab icon that it looked for but then 
didn't find.
