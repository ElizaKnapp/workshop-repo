K15 -- Sessions Greetings
2021-10-18

First, we ran the app from hw 14 and inputted a username. In the dev console,
we saw a get request from the localhost that we are running the app on,
but then, it said 404 not found when it searches for a favicon.ico. We looked
it up and it said that it was just the tab icon that it looked for but then
didn't find.

We have set up the conditional in app.py that checks whether the method
is a post or a get method to determine whether to use .args or .form.
We are not yet sure why it really matters what the difference is. We
have yet to create a session.

5:53PM - We have created a login session! Method can be specified in
<form action> to ensure the right method is being used.

Cookies! Stored locally! Server maintains the cookies, client uses them.
request.cookies.get('username') same as -> request.form['username']
Sessions in flask
- maintained by server, stored on client
- payload encoded (not encrypted)
- dictionary
- cookie is securely signed

NEW UPDATES FROM TUESDAY THE 19TH FROM CLASS:
First, instead of creating our own dictionary and checking the values, 
we imported sessions and created a session, adding an item
to the dictionary as we logged on using the correct username and 
password (checked against the request.forms argument of a post 
request). When it is time to log out, if the hardcoded username 
is in session, then it pops it off the list.
