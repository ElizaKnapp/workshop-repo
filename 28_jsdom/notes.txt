General observations:
* the specific explanations are in the comments

- when you type in the function (or the variable) name, it gives you
the code that defines that function or variable

Questions
- how do you remove ALL other css tags on a specific thing without knowing exactly what their names are
- what happens when you have "nested" elements? do you just keep appending .getElementByTagName or 
does the first .getElementByTagName find inner elements inside other elements?
