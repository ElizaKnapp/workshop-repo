General observations: 
* the specific explanations are in the comments

- when you type in the function (or the variable) name, it gives you
the code that defines that function or variable
- for automatic running of stuff when the page renders
  1. put the script function at the top so that it has access to all the functions like it's importing them
  2. you can use document.write(function_name(params))

Questions:
- how do you remove ALL other css tags on a specific thing without knowing exactly what their names are
- what happens when you have "nested" elements? do you just keep appending .getElementByTagName or 
does the first .getElementByTagName find inner elements inside other elements?
- can you use the document.write / dom stuff in flask? or do you have to make
a variable to conditionally render parts of the html that call the js that using 
document.write?
