Something crazy
- it works ONLY when I put the script at the end of the file?
- so i have added a script call twice?

Also:
- a better way (oopsies!) to call js right onto the page is just to call your functions
outside of the functions in the js file and they run automatically as you execute the script

you can use .value to get the value of an input from a specific element

to clear inputs after submitting, you can reset their values to null [not an empty string because I specified the type as an int]

document.createElement(<html tag name></html>)
element.setAttribute(name, value)
element.getAttribute(name)
element.remove()
element.innerHTML
element.appendChild(<element>)
element.addEventListener("event", "function")
