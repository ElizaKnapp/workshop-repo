Notes on Data Modeling with MongoDB
- you can dictate how the data is modeled
- change your data modeling- iterative design
- linking with different relationships
	- you can embed stuff when it's 1 to 1 or 1 to many
	- many to many relationships can contain arrays with the unique ids of the other linked thing
- you can have versions of scheme (one without email and one with)
- you decide which one you want to use
- at some point though, you have to sync them
- Bucket pattern- you can put small, related data items inside a specific elemtn- Computed pattern- precompute important numbers- update summary numbers when you push to db
