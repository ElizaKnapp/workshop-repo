K16 -- All About Database
2021-10-18

We discovered that sqlite3 in the terminal creates a shell where
we can run terminal commands. Following the notes, we created a 
database and inserted information into it using the terminal.
We learned that to exit sqlite3, you can use control + D.
When you want to work with a specific file, you can type .open
filename which we used (in addition to doing it in the .py file)
to check whether we uploaded values to the database correctly.

When we tried it for the db_builder, it worked, but then we had
to try to figure out how to add the values from the dictionary.
We discovered (googled) that since the insertion is all in quotation marks, 
we had to put question marks where we wanted variables and then put the 
variables in parentheses as the second argument.
