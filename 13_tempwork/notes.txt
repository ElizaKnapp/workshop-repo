Things we noted:
- random.choices seemed like the cleanest way to decide on an occupation
- to loop in html, we copied the existing structure of {%}
- it was cleaner to put our functions in a separate python file, import
into app.py and then use them like that, since we had already written the code.
- .values() on a dictionary makes a list of all the values
- .items() has key, value pairs in a dictionary which made our for loop 
convenient
- when you plug a file into the functions.py, you do actually need to 
specify that it is in the data folder
- we wonder, still, why the last row of the csv file is there. should
we be using it?!?

EGO:
- It was interesting to read about the "the code you wrote, instead of 
your code" part.
- Can relate to parts when you get a bit defensive about your code.
- Always better to write your code to be more readable, can also prevent
silly mistakes from happening by having code be more readable.
- Obvious benefits to working together on debugging code, and even when you are done,
you can send it to somebody else so that they can read the debugged version and make
sure that there are no errors.
- Will be working together on debugging more as a group, as that seems like an 
enormous benefit.
