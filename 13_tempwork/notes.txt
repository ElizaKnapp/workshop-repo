Things we noted:
- random.choices seemed like the cleanest way to decide on an occupation
- to loop in html, we copied the existing structure of {%}
- it was cleaner to put our functions in a separate python file, import
into app.py and then use them like that
- .values() on a dictionary makes a list of all the values
- .items() has key, value pairs in a dictionary which made our for loop 
convenient
- when you plug a file into the functions.py, you do actually need to 
specify that it is in the data folder
- we wonder, still, why the last row of the csv file is there. should
we be using it?!?
