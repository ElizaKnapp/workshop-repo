In app.py,
(app) refers to the program name
(request) refers to the url where the refresh was made, which differs depending on whether you refreshed the website on the response page or landing page
(request.args) refers to what was inputted, which we later find out is stored as a dictionary; also differs depending on which page you refreshed
(request.headers) returns the rest of the page assets, including the host, browser, and platform

Commented out (request.args['username']) would just print in terminal the username that was inputted
