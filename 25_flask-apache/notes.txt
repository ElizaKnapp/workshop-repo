What stuff means!

(particularly for deploying flask app w virtual host)

WSGI (web server gateway interface)- allows the server and the actual website to talk
- mod-wsgi is the wsgi that allows apache to serve flask apps

Pip- thing that's used to install flask stuff

ON ADDING P01:

to see errors run: sudo cat /var/log/apache2/error.log
this told me my local modules wouldn't load

this fixes my error- will edit files later:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/python-can-t-find-local-files-modules

above everything include these two lines:
import sys
sys.path.append("/var/www/FlaskApp/FlaskApp/")

Now to fix the db file problems:
1. sudo chown www-data:www-data your_db_file.db
2. put the db file in its own directory to be sure the permissions change properly- you can call it tmp
3. now, change all the "your_db_file.db" to "tmp/your_db_file.db"
4. finally, sudo chmod 755 tmp which changes the permission to rwx for the user and rx for everyone else
5. Now that the priviledges for the db file are in place, run sudo service apache2 restart again and hopefully it works? (if it doesn't, go find more problems by running: sudo cat /var/log/apache2/error.log)
