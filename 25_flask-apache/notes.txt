What stuff means!

(particularly for deploying flask app w virtual host)

WSGI (web server gateway interface)- allows the server and the actual website to talk
- mod-wsgi is the wsgi that allows apache to serve flask apps

Pip- thing that's used to install flask stuff

ON ADDING P01:

to see errors run: sudo cat /var/log/apache2/error.log
this told me my local modules wouldn't load

this fixes my error- will edit files later:
